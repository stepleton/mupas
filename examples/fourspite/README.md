Fourspite is a quick two-player strategy game for one or two Tektronix
4050-series computers. For more information on the game, see the comments
at the top of [fourspite.pas](fourspite.pas).

To compile Fourspite into Tektronix 4050-series BASIC, just run GNU make in
the current directory. The resulting file `fourspite.out` can be loaded into
the [Tektronix 4051 web emulator](
https://jonbstanley.github.io/Tek405xEmulator/jsTEKTRONIX4051.html) or onto
a real Tektronix 4050-series machine via whatever contrivance works for you.
I use the ["4050 GPIB Flash Drive"](
https://github.com/mmcgraw74/Tektronix-4050-GPIB-Flash-Drive) tape drive
emulator.
